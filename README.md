# Neural-Network-Powered-Daylight-Reconstruction-from-Nighttime-Imagery-
This project uses a deep neural network to reconstruct daylight scenes from nighttime imagery. By training on paired night-day images, the model learns to generate realistic daylight conditions from nighttime photos, providing enhanced visualization for various applications, including surveillance and environmental studies.
